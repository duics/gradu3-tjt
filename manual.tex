\title{\cls{Gradu} --- A Class for Writing Master's Thesis at the Faculty of
Information Technology of the University of Jyväskylä}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This class is designed to facilitate the writing of a Master's
  Thesis (and other thesis) work at the Department of Information
  Technology of the University of Jyväskylä.  It may also be used
  elsewhere if it conforms to their requirements.
\end{abstract}

\section{Read this first}

The class is provided currently on a ''beta test'' basis.  We urge you
to consider it your honor-bound duty to \emph{let us know of any
deficiencies} that you may find when using this class.  First,
however, please verify that any strangeness you may witness is not
mandated by the university publishing unit specifications!

While this class has already been used to typeset several subsequently
approved theses successfully, \emph{it is always your responsibility,
as the author,} to ensure that the document meets the requirements
set by the university and the faculty in question. This class aids in
that, but it does not, and cannot, implement the all of the
typesetting requirements.

Please check the master repository at
\url{http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.info/darcs/grady.cls/} periodically --
we make changes to the class from time to time. A log of changes is
available at
\url{http://antti-juhani.kaijanaho.info/darcs/darcsweb/darcsweb.cgi?r=gradu.cls;a=log}.%
\footnote{Apparent changes made by ''Automatic Date Tagger'' contain no actual
changes and may be safely ignored.}

Please, subscribe to the mailing list Tutkielma-TeX
(\url{http://lists.jyu.fi/mailman/listinfo/tutkielma-tex}), and ask
there any questions you might have.  The subscribers there may be able
to help you faster than we can.

\textbf{ATTENTION: starting with version 2.0, \cls{gradu} does not load
\pack{hyperref} automatically (nor does it load \pack{color} anymore).}

\section{Invocation}

Invoke the class with the usual \cmd{documentclass\{gradu2\}}.

\item[nocopyright] Do not output copyright assertion and license
  information.
\end{opts}

\section{Other options}

\item[logo] Use the logo of the university of Jyväskylä on the front page. The

warning message is generated and no logo is displayed.
\item[altlinespread] Use a linespread of 1.5 instead of 1.2, as required by
the university's layout rules (although it is ugly).
\end{opts}

\item[appendix] inserts an ``Appendices'' line into the table of contents and
the chapters inside the environments will be numbered with
letters instead of numbers, beginning from ``A''.
\item[chapterquote] allows you to add a quote to the beginning of a

  the quote.  You should start the text of the chapter immediately
  after this environment; do not leave empty lines there.
