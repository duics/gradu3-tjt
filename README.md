# gradu3-tjt
**WIP - Does not entirely match official guidelines yet**

This is an unofficial LaTeX-template for the students of Information Systems
Science in University of Jyväskylä.

The template is mostly based on the styles by
[datakurre/tutkielma](https://github.com/datakurre/tutkielma) applied on the
latest gradu3.cls file found from the
[ttl-gradu](https://yousource.it.jyu.fi/latex-thesis-classes/ttl-gradu)
repository.  The commit tree of ttl-gradu is preserved in the hope of making
updates to the template easier when there are changes in the main ttl-gradu
repository.

## Special Thanks
* [datakurre](https://github.com/datakurre) for maintaining the original
  repository
* [Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho](https://github.com/ajkaijanaho) for maintaining
  ttl-gradu repository and allowing the modified template to be hosted on
  github
