\title{\cls{Gradu} --- A Class for Writing Master's Thesis at the Faculty of
Information Technology of the University of Jyväskylä}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This class is designed to facilitate the writing of a Master's
  Thesis (and other thesis) work at the Department of Information
  Technology of the University of Jyväskylä.  It may also be used
  elsewhere if it conforms to their requirements.
\end{abstract}

\section{Read this first}

The class is provided currently on a ''beta test'' basis.  We urge you
to consider it your honor-bound duty to \emph{let us know of any
deficiencies} that you may find when using this class.  First,
however, please verify that any strangeness you may witness is not
mandated by the university publishing unit specifications!

While this class has already been used to typeset several subsequently
approved theses successfully, \emph{it is always your responsibility,
as the author,} to ensure that the document meets the requirements
set by the university and the faculty in question. This class aids in
that, but it does not, and cannot, implement the all of the
typesetting requirements.

Please, subscribe to the mailing list Tutkielma-TeX
(\url{http://lists.jyu.fi/mailman/listinfo/tutkielma-tex}), and ask
there any questions you might have.  The subscribers there may be able
to help you faster than we can.

We may make changes to the class from time to time.  New releases will
be announced on that mailing list.

\section{Invocation}

Invoke the class with the usual \cmd{documentclass\{gradu3\}}.  The
options discussed in the following subsections should be given to the
\cmd{documentclass} command as optional arguments
(e.g. \cmd{documentclass[utf8,english]\{gradu3\}}).

\subsection{Language Options}

Languages options set hyphenation, titles translations and date formats to the
selected language. The available languages are:

\begin{opts}
\item[finnish] switches to Finnish language (default)
\item[english] switches to English language
\end{opts}

You can switch at any time from one of those languages to the other one with
\cmd{selectlanguage\{}\textit{language}\texttt{\}}.

\subsection{Input Character Set}

Input character set options allow to specify with what character set the source file
is written. Available character sets are:

\begin{opts}
\item[ascii] ASCII encoding (ISO 646)

\item[latin1] ISO-8859-1 encoding (Western Europe languages) (default)
\item[latin2] ISO-8859-2 encoding (Central Europe languages)

\item[applemac] Macintosh encoding

\item[cp1252] synonym for \opt{ansinew}
\item[cp1250] MS Windows 1250 (central and eastern Europe languages) code page
\item[decmulti] DEC Multinational Character Set encoding
\item[next] Next encoding
\item[cp437] IBM 437 code page
\item[cp437de] IBM 437 code page (German version)
\item[cp850] IBM 850 code page
\item[cp852] IBM 852 code page
\item[cp865] IBM 865 code page
\end{opts}

Usual encodings, by platform, are:

\begin{description}
\item[Linux] \texttt{latin1} (or nowadays more often than not, \texttt{latin9} or  \texttt{utf8})
\item[MS Windows] \texttt{cp1252}
\item[Old Macintosh] \texttt{applemac}
\item[OS X] \texttt{utf8}
\end{description}

Note that these options are given to the \cmd{documentclass} command.
You should not invoke \cmd{usepackage\{inputenc\}} yourself!

\item[toc] Adds an entry in the TOC for the TOC
\item[shortthesis] This is a short thesis; no chapters will be used.
  (For Bachelor's theses etc.)
\item[altlinespread] Use a linespread of 1.5 instead of 1.2, as required by
the university's layout rules (although it is ugly).
\end{opts}

\section{Sectioning Commands}

The available sectioning commands are:

In addition to the previous commands, there are three useful environments:

\begin{envs}
\item[thebibliography] allows to specify a list of references. Should be put
before the appendices.
\item[appendix] inserts an ``Appendices'' line into the table of contents and
the chapters inside the environments will be numbered with
letters instead of numbers, beginning from ``A''.
\item[chapterquote] allows you to add a quote to the beginning of a
  chapter.  It takes one mandatory argument: the attribution line for
  the quote.  You should start the text of the chapter immediately
  after this environment; do not leave empty lines there.
\end{envs}

\appendix
\section{Command differences between gradu2 and gradu3}

\begin{itemize}
\item Options \opt{copyright} and \opt{nocopyright} and commands
  \cmd{copyrightowner}, \cmd{copyrightyear} and \cmd{license} have
  been removed.  No copyright information is output by default.
\item Options \opt{numbib} and \opt{nonumbib} have been removed.  The
  class now behaves like the old \opt{nonumbib} option.
\item Options \opt{oldtitle} and \opt{newtitle} have been removed.
  The class only supports the title format previously known as
  ``oldtitle''.
\item Option \opt{surnamefirst} has been removed as unnecessary.  The
  author can specify their name in whatever format they desire.
\item Command \opt{setauthor} has been removed.  The standard
  \LaTeXe{} command \cmd{author} should be used in its stead.
\item Option \opt{altsubsec} has been removed and its functionality is
  not supported.
\item Option \opt{palatino} has been removed and its functionality is
  not supported.
\item Option \opt{logo} has been removed and its functionality is not
  supported.
\end{itemize}
